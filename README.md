# Google Home - Home Assistant Companion app ðŸš§

Status - `In Development`

### Problem
- Google Home APIs can only be used from an Android environment. [There isn't a REST API endpoint planned for the near future](https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Smart-Home-Developer-Forum/Will-the-Google-Home-APIs-be-available-as-a-direct-REST-API-without-the/m-p/668079).
- Home Assistant does not have visibility to legacy, non-Matter supported IoT devices that support Google Home, without the use of Tasmota or similar tools and/or further development.
- Google Home Runtime isn't integrated with Home Assistant yet.

### Solution

- Build a Google Home API Android app to act as a bridge between Google Home and Home Assistant until the time Home Runtime is built into Home Assistant.

The *Google Home - Home Assistant Companion App*  will be running in a container environment, acting as a bridge between Google Home and Home Assistant using MQTT, much like Frigate and other bridge-type HACS integrations.

> This might be a temporary solution until the time that at least one of the above-mentioned problem definitions is fixed.
